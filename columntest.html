					<p>AZVA has developed in the past eight years several techniques to achieve what we have in our artfolio today. In all these years, we have worked with many different animation and rendering packages, from proprietary to open-source, always with the final image in mind. We believe that more important than the process in itself, it is the end product that deserves all the attention. </p>
				<p>AZVA can achieve images within various stages of definition of the project. The purpose here is to deliver a beautiful and communicating image and, as such, all we need is to know what the client needs to communicate. We can build the 3D model, or also work with in-studio developed 3d models. We can also pick an embrionary stage of the project and develop architectural language in order to better show off the idea to a client or a jury. As architects, AZVA has the flexibility to work with the building in much more ways than a simple illustrator could. AZVA builds images.
